Hello world!? I am a sociologist interested in how working while studying at university shapes students' life courses, and the stratifications of risks and gains of student employment. I am currently the Project manager of [Mapineq](https://mapineq.eu) â€“ Mapping inequalities through the life course, a Horizon Europe project coordinated by the University of Turku in Finland. Additionally, I am also an affiliated Postdoctoral Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Vienna, Austria. Previously, I worked as postdoctoral researcher at the Diversity & Inclusion Office at Erasmus University Rotterdam, the Netherlands and at the University Libre of Brussels, Belgium.

I hold a Ph.D. in Sociology from the Autonomous University of Barcelona (2019), a Master's in Management and Policies in Higher Education (2012), and a Bachelor's in Psychology (2009), both from my hometown University of Guadalajara in Mexico. During my doctoral studies, I had the opportunity to be a visiting researcher in different research centers, institutes, or groups: [IREDU](https://iredu.u-bourgogne.fr) in Burgundy, France (Erasmus+ Traineeship, 2017), [CIRES](https://www.vu.edu.au/centre-for-international-research-on-education-systems-cires) in Melbourne, Australia (Endeavour Research Fellowship, 2018), and [SILC](https://research.vu.nl/en/organisations/social-inequality-and-the-life-course-silc-2) in Amsterdam, the Netherlands (SEBAP mobility award, 2018).

Regarding the more sincere backstory of my academic trajectory, a 3-year doctoral contract pushed me to apply for funding to finish my dissertation. However, it wasn't enough. During the last year of my Ph.D., I also worked one night a week helping the brewer at the famous brewery of the ostrich in Amsterdam (Brouwerij 't IJ).

This website is my celebratory act for having been lucky enough to be granted the [MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/news/marie-sklodowska-curie-actions-award-eu260-million-to-postdoctoral-researchers-in-2023) (2023), despite the discouragement of not reaching the threshold in my first attempt in 2022.
