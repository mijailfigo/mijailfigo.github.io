Hello world!? I am a sociologist interested on how working while studying at university shapes students' life courses, and the stratifications of risks and gains of student employment. I am currently the Project manager of [Mapineq](https://mapineq.eu) â€“ Mapping inequalities through the life course, a Horizon Europe project coordinated by the University of Turku in Finland. I am also a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Venna, Austria. I previously worked as postdoctoral researcher at the Diversity & Inclusion Office at Erasmus University Rotterdam, the Netherlands and at the University Libre of Brussels, Belgium.
