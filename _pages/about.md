I am a sociologist interested in how working while studying at university shapes students’ life courses and the stratifications of risks and gains associated with student employment. I was recently awarded a [Marie Sklodowska-Curie fellowship]( https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/news/marie-sklodowska-curie-actions-award-eu260-million-to-postdoctoral-researchers-in-2023) for my project [GROW]( https://mijailfigo.github.io/projects/grow/), which aims to investigate who benefits and who faces challenges when working while studying, and under what conditions. GROW will start in September 2025 and continue for two years.

I am currently the [Project Manager of Mapineq](https://mijailfigo.github.io/projects/mapineq/) – Mapping Inequalities through the Life Course, a Horizon Europe project coordinated by the University of Turku in Finland. I am also an affiliated Postdoctoral Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Vienna, Austria. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Erasmus University Rotterdam and the Université libre de Bruxelles.

I hold a Ph.D. in Sociology from the Autonomous University of Barcelona (2019), where I explored the influence of social origin and academic programs on the motivations for working while studying among Catalan university students. My doctoral journey was enriched by research visits to the [Social Inequalities and the Life Course group (SILC)](https://research.vu.nl/en/organisations/social-inequality-and-the-life-course-silc-2) at VU Amsterdam, the [Centre for International Research on Education Systems (CIRES)]( https://www.vu.edu.au/centre-for-international-research-on-education-systems-cires) at Victoria University, and the [Institut de Recherche sur l’Éducation (IREDU)](https://iredu.u-bourgogne.fr) at the University of Burgundy.
