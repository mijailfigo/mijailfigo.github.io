Hello world!? I am a sociologist interested on how student employment at university shapes students' life courses. Since January 2013, I am the Project manager of [Mapineq](https://mapineq.eu) â€“ Mapping inequalities through the life course, a Horizon Europe project coordinated by the University of Turku in Finland. I previously worked as postdoctoral researcher at the Erasmus University Rotterdam in the Netherlands and the University Libre of Brussels in Belgium. I am also a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Venna, Austria.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
