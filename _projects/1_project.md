As a Project Manager, I assist the project coordinator in maintaining an overview of the project by monitoring the development of tasks and keeping our funding body informed.

Ensuring quality is a fundamental component of project management. I implement the quality assurance procedure for all the project’s deliverables, which involves an internal double-peer review process before submitting manuscripts to the European Commission.

Excellent internal communication is a key element towards achieving the project’s objectives. I ensure the ongoing synergy of the team by coordinating an online consortium meeting every three weeks and organizing biannual in-person consortium meetings.

Engaging and informative external communication amplifies the project’s impact. I maintain oversight of the project’s communication efforts, which encompass our website, as well as social media platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn, in addition to our biannual newsletter. I ensure that each message is aligned with our visual identity and crafted not just to inform but to resonate. Every message is also meant to enhance team members’ sense of pride in being part of the project.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.
